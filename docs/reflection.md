# Reflection

## What I learned
I learned how to create a repository, edit a README, and manage work using Issues. I also learned how to create branches, make commits, and use Pull Requests to merge changes into the main branch.

## Most challenging part
The most challenging part was understanding branches and Pull Requests at first. After practicing the steps, it became easier and I understood why they help prevent mistakes.

## What I would improve next
If I had more time, I would improve the design, add more challenges, and create a real progress tracker that saves the user’s completed tasks.
